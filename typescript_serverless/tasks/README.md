# Implementation Tasks - Ultimate Type Safety Serverless Template

## Overview

This directory contains granular implementation tasks for building the Ultimate Type Safety Serverless Template. Each task is designed to be independent, well-documented, and implementable by any developer on the team.

## Task Structure

### Directory Organization

```
tasks/
├── 01-type-safety-environment/    # Foundation: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript
├── 02-docker-environment/         # Development: Docker, Init Scripts, Workflow
├── 03-shared-libraries/           # Core: Zod Schemas, Clean Architecture, Patterns
├── 04-authentication/             # Auth: OAuth, JWT, Repository
├── 05-ui-components/              # UI: shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Components
├── 06-member-api/                 # API: Member endpoints and logic
├── 07-admin-api/                  # API: Admin endpoints and management
├── 08-member-frontend/            # Frontend: Member application
├── 09-admin-frontend/             # Frontend: Admin application
├── 10-infrastructure/             # AWS: CDK, Lambda, DynamoDB
├── 11-testing/                    # QA: Test pyramid, E2E, Integration
├── 12-documentation-cicd/         # Docs: OpenAPI, CI/CD, Documentation
└── 13-completion/                 # Final: Polish, Templates, Deployment
```

### Task Naming Convention

- `XX-YY-task-name.md` where:
  - `XX` = Section number (01-13)
  - `YY` = Task number within section (01-04)
  - `task-name` = Descriptive name

## Progress Tracking (CRITICAL)

### Progress Directory

**Every developer MUST record progress in `@progress/` directory**

For each task you work on, create a progress file:

```
@progress/XX-YY-task-name.md
```

### Required Progress Information

Each progress file must include:

- Implementation steps completed
- Issues encountered and solutions found
- Time spent on the task
- Files created/modified
- Testing results and verification steps
- Handoff notes for the next developer
- Any deviations from the original plan

### Progress Template

```markdown
# Progress: Task XX.YY - Task Name

## Developer Info

- **Developer**: [Your Name]
- **Start Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Status**: [In Progress/Completed/Blocked]

## Implementation Progress

- [ ] Step 1 completed
- [ ] Step 2 completed
- [ ] Step 3 in progress

## Time Tracking

- **Estimated**: X hours
- **Actual**: Y hours
- **Efficiency**: [Notes on estimation accuracy]

## Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: [Brief description]

**Solution**: [How it was resolved]

## Files Modified

- `path/to/file1.ts` - [What was changed]
- `path/to/file2.json` - [Configuration updates]

## Testing Results

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Handoff Notes

[Important information for next developer or task dependencies]

## Deviations

[Any changes from original task specification]
```

## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path (Cannot be parallelized)

1. **01-01** → All other tasks (monorepo foundation)
2. **01-02** → All development (type safety foundation)
3. **03-01** → Most development tasks (schema foundation)

### High-Impact Blockers

- **02-02** (Docker) → Testing and development workflow
- **04-01-04-03** (Auth system) → All API development
- **05-01-05-03** (UI foundation) → All frontend development

### Parallel Work Opportunities

- Type safety tasks (01-02, 01-03) can be done in parallel
- API development (06-_, 07-_) can be done in parallel after auth
- Frontend development (08-_, 09-_) can be done in parallel after UI foundation

## Implementation Strategy

### TDD-First Approach

All tasks should follow the RED → GREEN → BLUE cycle:

- **RED**: Write failing tests first
- **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
- **BLUE**: Refactor for quality and performance

### Quality Standards

- **Type Safety**: Zero ESLint errors/warnings, zero TypeScript errors
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for all packages
- **Architecture**: 100% Clean Architecture compliance
- **Member/Admin Symmetry**: Consistent patterns across both APIs

### Time Estimation Guidelines

- **Junior Developer**: Use estimated time × 1.5
- **Senior Developer**: Use estimated time as-is
- **Expert Developer**: Use estimated time × 0.8

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Task

- Check dependencies in task file
- Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed
- Consider your skill level and available time

### 2. Create Progress File

```bash
cp tasks/progress-template.md progress/XX-YY-task-name.md
```

### 3. Follow Task Instructions

- Read implementation reference documents
- Follow step-by-step implementation guide
- Record progress continuously

### 4. Verify Completion

- Check all acceptance criteria
- Run quality checks (lint, test, build)
- Update progress file with final status

## Help and Support

### Reference Documentation

- Implementation guides in `@docs/impl/`
- Architecture decisions in `@docs/design.md`
- Project requirements in `@docs/requirements.md`

### Common Issues

- Check progress files from previous tasks
- Review implementation reference documents
- Ensure all dependencies are properly completed

**Remember**: The goal is not just to complete tasks, but to build a maintainable, type-safe, and well-documented system that serves as a template for future projects.
