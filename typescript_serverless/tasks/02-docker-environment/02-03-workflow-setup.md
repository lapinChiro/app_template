# Task 2.3: Development Workflow Configuration

## Overview

Implement GitHub Flow with atomic commits, comprehensive quality gates via pre-commit/pre-push hooks, and TDD cycle automation scripts.

## Description

Set up the complete development workflow including Git hooks for quality enforcement, Knip configuration for unused code detection, and automation scripts that support the TDD development cycle.

## Requirements

- GitHub Flow + atomic commits configuration
- Pre-commit/pre-push hooks with quality gates
- Knip setup for unused code detection
- TDD cycle automation scripts
- Code quality enforcement automation

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**: Task 1.3 (Prettier pre-commit hooks), Task 2.1 (project configuration)
- **Blocks**: Task 12.3 (CI/CD pipeline)
- **Can work in parallel with**: Task 2.2 (Docker environment)

## Implementation Reference

- [`@docs/impl/workflow/github-flow.md`](../docs/impl/workflow/github-flow.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Git hooks configured (husky)
- [ ] Pre-commit: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript check
- [ ] Pre-push: Tests + Knip + Build verification
- [ ] Knip configuration for unused code detection
- [ ] TDD automation scripts (test watch, cycle helpers)
- [ ] Atomic commit guidelines enforced
- [ ] Quality gate bypass prevention

## Technical Requirements

- **Quality Gates**: Zero failures allowed in hooks
- **Performance**: Hook execution < 30 seconds
- **TDD Support**: Test feedback < 5 seconds
- **Team Consistency**: No quality gate bypassing

## Quality Gates to Implement

```bash
# Pre-commit checks
- ESLint (zero errors/warnings)
- Prettier formatting
- TypeScript compilation
- Staged file validation

# Pre-push checks
- Unit test execution
- Knip unused code detection
- Build verification
- Integration test (if available)
```

## Progress Tracking

**IMPORTANT**: Record your progress in `@progress/02-03-workflow-setup.md`

Create a progress file with:

- Git hooks implementation and testing
- Knip configuration and results
- TDD automation scripts created
- Quality gate performance metrics
- Team workflow documentation
- Bypass prevention measures

## Estimated Time

4-6 hours

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up husky for Git hooks
2. Configure pre-commit hooks (lint, format, type)
3. Configure pre-push hooks (test, knip, build)
4. Set up Knip for unused code detection
5. Create TDD automation scripts
6. Implement atomic commit validation
7. Test all quality gates thoroughly
8. Document workflow for team
9. Create troubleshooting guide
