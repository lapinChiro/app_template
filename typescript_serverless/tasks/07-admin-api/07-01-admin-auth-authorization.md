# Task 7.1: Admin Authentication and Authorization System

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Admin authentication and authorization with role checking middleware, Google OAuth for admin users, and audit logging for all administrative operations.

## Description

Create a robust admin authentication system that enforces admin-only access, integrates with Google OAuth for admin role assignment, and implements comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security monitoring.

## Requirements

- Admin role enforcement middleware
- Google OAuth integration with admin role assignment
- Comprehensive audit logging system
- Administrative operation tracking
- Security monitoring and alerts

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**: Task 3.1 (schemas), Task 4.1 (OAuth), Task 4.2 (JWT)
- **Blocks**: Tasks 7.2-7.3 (Admin functionality), Task 9.1 (Admin frontend)
- **Can work in parallel with**: Task 6.1 (Member API foundation)

## Implementation Reference

- [`@docs/impl/auth/admin-crud.md`](../docs/impl/auth/admin-crud.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Admin role checking middleware
- [ ] Google OAuth with admin role enforcement
- [ ] Audit logging for all admin operations
- [ ] Administrative session management
- [ ] Security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Admin-only endpoint protection
- [ ] Unauthorized access prevention
- [ ] Compliance logging format

## Technical Requirements

- **Security**: Admin role verification on every request
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete operation logging
- **Performance**: Authorization check < 50ms
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security event tracking

## Admin Authorization System

```typescript
// Core admin authorization to implement:
interface AdminAuthMiddleware {
  requireAdmin: (req: NextRequest) => Promise<{ admin: User } | NextResponse>;
  auditLog: (operation: string, adminId: string, details: AuditDetails) => Promise<void>;
  validateAdminSession: (token: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  trackSecurityEvent: (event: SecurityEvent) => void;
}

// Audit logging structure
interface AuditLog {
  timestamp: string;
  adminId: string;
  operation: string;
  resource: string;
  changes: Record<string, unknown>;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  result: 'success' | 'failure';
}
```

## Progress Tracking

**IMPORTANT**: Record your progress in `@progress/07-01-admin-auth-authorization.md`

Create a progress file with:

- Admin middleware implementation details
- OAuth admin role assignment logic
- Audit logging system design
- Security monitoring setup
- Performance testing results
- Compliance verification checklist

## Estimated Time

8-10 hours

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement admin role checking middleware
2. Set up Google OAuth with admin role assignment
3. Create comprehensive audit logging system
4. Implement security monitoring and alerts
5. Set up administrative session management
6. Create unauthorized access prevention
7. Test admin authorization flow
8. Verify audit logging compliance
9. Document security procedures
