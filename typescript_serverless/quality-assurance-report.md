## Failed Tests Details

1. **UserRepository - Update Operations**
   - File: `src/repositories/__tests__/user.repository.update.test.ts`
   - Failed tests:
     - "should update user with valid input"
     - "should update user role"
     - "should update user last login timestamp"
     - "should return false when deleting non-existent user"
   - Common issue: Mock returns null/undefined instead of expected user objects

2. **UserRepository - Query Operations**
   - File: `src/repositories/__tests__/user.repository.query.test.ts`
   - Failed test: "should return users with specific role"
   - Issue: Spy not called with expected arguments

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Failing Tests** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Review UserRepository implementation and ensure update methods return proper values
   - Check mock configurations in test files
   - Verify database client mock behavior

2. **Install Dependencies** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Run `pnpm install` in root directory
   - Ensure all workspace packages have their dependencies installed
   - Verify Next.js is available in web apps

3. **Re-run Quality Checks** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - After fixing tests and dependencies, run full quality check again
   - Ensure all tests pass with coverage data
   - Verify successful builds

## Quality Gates Status

❌ **Pre-Commit**: BLOCKED
- TypeScript: ✅ Pass
- ESLint: ✅ Pass
- Unit Tests: ❌ Fail

❌ **Pre-Push**: BLOCKED
- All pre-commit checks must pass first

❌ **Pre-Deploy**: BLOCKED
- Build must succeed
- All tests must pass

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate fixes**:
   - Fix the 5 failing tests in @shared/core
   - Install missing dependencies for Next.js apps
   - Re-run all quality checks

2. **Follow-up actions**:
   - Add test coverage reporting after tests pass
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Consider adding pre-commit hooks to catch these issues earlier

3. **Long-term improvements**:
   - Implement automated dependency checks
   - Add CI/CD pipeline to catch build issues
   - Set up automated quality gates

## Conclusion

The codebase has good TypeScript and ESLint compliance (0 errors), and no security vulnerabilities. However, failing tests and missing dependencies are blocking successful builds and deployments. These issues must be resolved before the code can be considered production-ready.
