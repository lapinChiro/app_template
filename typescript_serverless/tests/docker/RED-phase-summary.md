# RED Phase Summary - Docker Development Environment Tests

## Phase: RED
## Task: Docker Development Environment Setup (01-04)

### Test Files Created

1. **`tests/docker/docker-environment.test.ts`**
   - Comprehensive test suite for Docker configuration
   - Tests for Dockerfile requirements
   - Tests for compose.yml configuration
   - Security hardening validation
   - Performance requirements validation

2. **`tests/docker/docker-validation.test.ts`**
   - Docker directory structure validation
   - Build performance checks
   - Development workflow validation
   - Integration tests for complete setup

3. **`tests/docker/jest.config.js`**
   - Test configuration for Docker tests
   - Coverage thresholds set to 90%+

### Test Categories

#### 1. Dockerfile Tests
- ✅ Base image validation (node:22-bookworm-slim)
- ✅ Multi-stage build pattern
- ✅ Security features (non-root user, dumb-init)
- ✅ Layer caching optimization
- ✅ Build size validation (< 300MB)

#### 2. Docker Compose Tests
- ✅ Docker Compose V2 compliance (no version field)
- ✅ DynamoDB Local configuration
- ✅ Service dependencies and health checks
- ✅ Profile-based service management
- ✅ Volume configuration for hot reload
- ✅ Environment variable setup

#### 3. Security Tests
- ✅ Non-root user execution
- ✅ Proper signal handling with dumb-init
- ✅ APT cache cleanup
- ✅ No high/critical vulnerabilities check

#### 4. Performance Tests
- ✅ Image size validation
- ✅ Container startup time requirements
- ✅ BuildKit caching features
- ✅ Layer optimization

#### 5. Development Experience Tests
- ✅ Hot reload configuration
- ✅ Volume mounts for development
- ✅ npm scripts for Docker commands
- ✅ Environment configuration

### Expected Failures (RED Phase)

All tests are expected to fail because:
1. No `Dockerfile` exists yet
2. No `compose.yml` exists yet
3. No `docker/` directory structure
4. No `.dockerignore` file
5. No `.env.example` file
6. No Docker-related npm scripts

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies first
pnpm install

# Run Docker tests
npm run test:docker

# Run with coverage
npm run test:docker -- --coverage
```

### Next Steps (GREEN Phase)

To make these tests pass, implement:
1. Create `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build
2. Create `compose.yml` with all required services
3. Create `docker/dev.Dockerfile` for development
4. Create `.dockerignore` file
5. Create `.env.example` with required variables
6. Implement all Docker-related configurations

### Test-Driven Development Benefits

1. **Clear Requirements**: Tests define exact specifications
2. **Quality Assurance**: All acceptance criteria are testable
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
4. **Confidence**: Changes can be made safely with test coverage
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support in tests

### Type Safety in Tests

- No `any` types used
- Proper type definitions for Docker configurations
- Test data builders for creating test fixtures
- Complete type coverage with interfaces

### Code Quality Metrics

- Target: 90%+ statement coverage
- Target: 85%+ branch coverage
- Target: 90%+ function coverage
- Target: 90%+ line coverage

This completes the RED phase. All tests are written and failing as expected.
