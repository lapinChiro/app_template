# Task Handover Log

## Purpose
This file tracks important handover information from completed tasks including generated files, environment changes, and any issues encountered during development.

## Recent Handovers

### Task 03-03: Auth Middleware & Guards (Updated)
**Completed**: 2025-07-29T13:15:00Z
**Developer**: claude

**Handover Information**:
  - Generated: packages/shared/src/auth/middleware.ts - Core authentication middleware with type-safe implementation
  - Generated: packages/shared/src/auth/guards.ts - Role-based access control guards with proper TypeScript types
  - Generated: packages/shared/src/auth/nextjs-middleware.ts - Next.js specific middleware
  - Generated: Comprehensive test coverage with type-safe mock helpers
  - Environment: Installed @types/express for type definitions
  - Commands: npm run lint (0 errors), npm test (508 tests passed), npm run typecheck (0 errors), npm run build (successful)
  - Implementation: TDD approach with RED-GREEN-BLUE cycle completed
  - Quality: All quality checks passing - lint, test, typecheck, build
  - Security: JWT verification with automatic refresh, role-based guards

**Quality Fixes Performed**:
  - Removed all eslint-disable comments from test files
  - Fixed Vite version conflicts (5.4.19 vs 6.3.5) by updating to compatible versions
  - Implemented type-safe mock helpers for tests to avoid any types
  - Split long test functions to meet line limits
  - Fixed unsafe type assignments using proper type assertions

**Key Learnings**:
  - Test code requires higher quality standards than production code (no any types, no eslint-disable)
  - Environment issues (like Vite version conflicts) must be fixed before continuing development
  - All quality checks (lint, test, typecheck, build) must pass with zero errors for Production Ready status

**Current State**:
  - All auth middleware and guards are fully implemented with proper TypeScript types
  - Comprehensive test coverage with proper type safety (no any types or eslint-disable)
  - Zero quality issues remaining - Production Ready status achieved
  - Cleanup: None required

- Environment: Installed @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb@3.729.0 and @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb@3.729.0
- Commands: npm test src/repositories, npm run typecheck, npm run lint
