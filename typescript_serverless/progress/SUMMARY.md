   - Core authentication infrastructure
   - Estimated: 3 hours

3. **03-03: Auth Middleware Guards** (Priority: High)
   - Depends on 03-01 and 03-02
   - Required for all protected routes
   - Estimated: 2 hours

## 📈 Velocity Metrics
- **Average**: 6 tasks/day (based on current session)
- **Today**: 6 tasks completed
- **Trend**: 🚀 Excellent progress

## ⚠️ Current Status
- All foundation and core infrastructure tasks completed
- Authentication system (03-xx) is now the critical path
- No blockers - ready to proceed with OAuth implementation

## 🔄 Critical Path Analysis
The authentication system (03-01, 03-02, 03-03) forms the next critical milestone as it blocks:
- Frontend applications (04-xx tasks)
- API implementation (05-xx tasks)
- Testing infrastructure setup

Completing the authentication tasks will unlock parallel development of both frontend apps and API routes.
