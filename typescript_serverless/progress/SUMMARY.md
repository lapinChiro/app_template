## 🚀 Active Development
### Currently In Progress
*No tasks currently in progress*

### Recently Completed
*No tasks completed yet*

## 🎯 Critical Path
Based on dependencies and impact:

1. **01-01**: Project Structure Setup (Foundation - blocks all other tasks)
2. **01-02**: TypeScript Configuration (blocks 15+ tasks requiring TypeScript)
3. **01-03**: ESLint Ultimate Type Safety (critical for type safety goals)
4. **02-01**: Shared Package Setup (blocks authentication and API tasks)
5. **02-03**: Zod Schema Definitions (blocks API implementation)

## 📈 Velocity Metrics
- **Average**: 0.0 tasks/day (no data yet)
- **This Week**: 0 tasks completed
- **Last Week**: N/A
- **Trend**: - Starting

## ⚠️ Risks & Blockers
### High Priority Dependencies
- **01-01** must be completed first (blocks 24 tasks)
- **01-02** TypeScript setup blocks most development tasks
- **02-01** and **02-03** block authentication and API implementation

### Estimated Timeline
- **Total Estimated Hours**: 71 hours
- **At 8 hours/day**: ~9 working days
- **At 6 hours/day**: ~12 working days
- **With dependencies**: ~3 weeks

## 🔄 Next Recommended Tasks
1. **01-01**: Project Structure Setup (no dependencies, critical foundation)
2. **01-04**: Docker Development Environment (can be done in parallel with 01-02)
3. **07-01**: CDK Project Setup (can be done in parallel, only depends on 01-01)
