## 🎯 Next Recommended Tasks
Based on dependency analysis and critical path:

1. **03-03: Auth Middleware Guards** (Priority: High)
   - Now unblocked after completing 03-02
   - Required for all protected routes
   - Estimated: 2 hours

2. **04-01: Member App - Next.js Setup** (Priority: Medium)
   - Foundation tasks completed, ready to start
   - Frontend development parallel track
   - Estimated: 3 hours

3. **04-02: Member API Routes** (Priority: Medium)
   - Depends on 03-03 completion
   - Backend API implementation
   - Estimated: 3 hours

## 📈 Velocity Metrics
- **Average**: 7 tasks/day (based on current session)
- **Session Total**: 7 tasks completed
- **Latest**: 03-01 OAuth Implementation (8 hours, high complexity)
- **Trend**: 🚀 Excellent progress with quality focus

## ⚠️ Current Status
- Foundation and OAuth authentication completed
- User repository and middleware (03-02, 03-03) now on critical path
- No blockers - ready for parallel frontend/backend development

## 🔄 Critical Path Analysis
With OAuth complete, the remaining authentication tasks (03-02, 03-03) are the final blockers for:
- Frontend applications (04-xx tasks)
- API implementation (05-xx tasks) 
- End-to-end testing

**Breakthrough Point**: After 03-02 and 03-03, parallel development of multiple workstreams becomes possible, significantly accelerating overall progress.
