## 🎯 Next Recommended Tasks
Based on dependency analysis and critical path:

1. **01-04: Docker Development Environment** (Priority: Critical)
   - All dependencies satisfied (01-01 completed)
   - Foundation task for consistent development
   - Estimated: 3 hours

2. **04-01: Member Next.js App Setup** (Priority: Medium)
   - All dependencies satisfied (02-02, 03-01 completed)
   - Frontend development track
   - Estimated: 3 hours

3. **05-01: Member API Routes** (Priority: Medium)
   - All dependencies satisfied (02-03, 03-03 completed)
   - Backend API implementation
   - Estimated: 3 hours

4. **04-02: Admin Next.js App Setup** (Priority: Medium)
   - All dependencies satisfied (02-02, 03-01 completed)
   - Admin frontend track
   - Estimated: 4 hours

5. **06-01: Unit Test Setup** (Priority: High)
   - Foundation for testing infrastructure
   - No dependencies
   - Estimated: 2 hours

## 📈 Velocity Metrics
- **Average**: 3.0 tasks/day (based on 3-day period)
- **Session Total**: 9 tasks completed
- **Latest**: 03-03 Auth Middleware (2 hours, completed efficiently)
- **Trend**: 🚀 Excellent progress with consistent quality

## ⚠️ Current Status
- Authentication system fully implemented (OAuth, Repository, Middleware)
- All foundation and core infrastructure tasks completed
- Multiple parallel development paths now available
- No blockers - ready for accelerated development

## 🔄 Critical Path Analysis
With authentication complete, the project has reached a **breakthrough point**:
- Frontend applications (04-xx) can proceed independently
- API implementation (05-xx) can proceed in parallel
- Testing infrastructure (06-xx) can be set up concurrently
- Infrastructure as Code (07-xx) can begin

**Recommended Strategy**: 
1. Set up Docker environment for consistent development (01-04)
2. Parallelize frontend (04-01) and backend (05-01) development
3. Begin testing infrastructure setup (06-01) for quality assurance

**Estimated Completion**: At current velocity (3 tasks/day), the remaining 16 tasks could be completed by August 2, 2025.
