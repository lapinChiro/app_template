# Task Progress Tracker Agent

Task and progress management agent supporting systematic development workflow. Primarily invoked from `/dev` command to manage development cycle start and completion.

## Role

- **Progress Analysis**: Understanding current task status
- **Task Selection**: Selecting optimal tasks based on critical path
- **Dependency Management**: Tracking blocked/unblocked tasks
- **Progress Documentation**: Structured records using YAML frontmatter
- **Next Task Recommendation**: Suggesting optimal task order

## Usage

### Invocation

1. **Via Task Tool**:

   ```
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "task-progress-tracker"
   - prompt: "[command] [arguments]"
   ```

2. **Explicit Request**:

   ```
   > Use the task-progress-tracker sub-agent to analyze progress
   ```

### Primary Commands

#### `analyze` (or no command)

- **Purpose**: Analyze current progress and select optimal next task
- **When to use**: Step 1 of /dev execution
- **Referenced files**:
  - `progress/SUMMARY.md` - Check completion status and "Next Recommended Tasks" section
  - `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md` - Check for any interrupted tasks
  - `progress/HANDOVER.md` - Review recent handover notes
  - Selected task file from SUMMARY.md (e.g., `tasks/02-02-ui-component-library.md`)
  - Dependency task completion records (e.g., `progress/completed/01-02.md`, `progress/completed/02-01.md`)
- **Process**: 
  1. Read SUMMARY.md to get the first recommended task
  2. Check if any task is already in progress
  3. Read the selected task file for requirements
  4. Read completed records of tasks listed in `depends_on` field
  5. Extract key decisions and implementations from dependencies
- **Output**: Selected task ID, requirements, and dependency context

#### `start XX-YY`

- **Purpose**: Mark task as started in IN_PROGRESS.md
- **When to use**: After task selection, before implementation begins
- **Referenced files**:
  - `progress/templates/in-progress.md` - IN_PROGRESS.md format
  - `progress/templates/task-file.md` - Individual task file format
- **Process**:
  1. Add new entry to `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md` (using template)
  2. Create `progress/in-progress/XX-YY.md` file
  3. Update task YAML frontmatter with `task_status: 'in_progress'`

#### `complete XX-YY with handover: [information]`

- **Purpose**: Mark task as completed, clean up tracking, and record handover information
- **When to use**: After all quality checks pass
- **Referenced files**:
  - `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md` - Entry to remove
  - `progress/in-progress/XX-YY.md` - File to move
  - `progress/HANDOVER.md` - Handover information destination
- **Process**:
  1. Remove entry from `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md`
  2. Move `progress/in-progress/XX-YY.md` to `progress/completed/XX-YY.md`
  3. Update task YAML frontmatter with `task_status: 'completed'`
  4. Update `depends_on` for tasks in `blocks_tasks`
  5. Add handover information to `progress/HANDOVER.md`:
     - Generated files (reports, logs, etc.)
     - Environment state changes
     - Important commands
     - Known issues or warnings
     - Temporary file cleanup status

#### `summary`

- **Purpose**: Update SUMMARY.md with latest project metrics
- **When to use**: After task completion
- **Referenced files**:
  - `progress/templates/summary.md` - SUMMARY.md template
  - All files in `progress/completed/` - Completed tasks
  - `tasks/**/*.md` - All task files for dependency analysis
- **Process**:
  1. Count completed tasks from `progress/completed/`
  2. Read all task files to analyze dependencies and calculate next recommendations
  3. Calculate completion rate, velocity, and critical path
  4. Regenerate `progress/SUMMARY.md` with pre-calculated "Next Recommended Tasks"
- **Note**: This is the only command that reads all task files, to ensure accurate dependency analysis

#### Other Commands

- `pause XX-YY` - Save current state and pause task
- `next` - Get next task recommendation without full analysis
- `blocked` - Show blocked tasks
- `report` - Generate detailed progress report

### Command Output Format

## Algorithm and Implementation Details

### Task Selection Algorithm (Optimized)

#### Efficient Task Selection

1. Read `progress/SUMMARY.md` - Already contains calculated "Next Recommended Tasks"
2. Take the first task from recommended list
3. Check `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md` for any active tasks
4. Read only the selected task file (e.g., `tasks/02-02-ui-component-library.md`)
5. Read completion records of dependency tasks listed in `depends_on` field

#### Why This Works

- SUMMARY.md is regenerated after each task completion
- Next recommended tasks are pre-calculated based on:
  - Dependency satisfaction
  - Critical path analysis
  - Task size and category progress
- No need to read all 25 task files every time
- Dependency context is obtained from completion records
- Reduces file reads from ~30 to ~5-7 (depending on dependencies)

### Progress Management Directory Structure

```
progress/
â”œâ”€â”€ SUMMARY.md          # Overall progress summary (auto-updated)
â”œâ”€â”€ IN_PROGRESS.md      # Currently active tasks (important for interruption handling)
â”œâ”€â”€ HANDOVER.md         # Task handover information (auto-updated)
â”œâ”€â”€ completed/          # Completed task records
â”œâ”€â”€ in-progress/        # In-progress tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ backlog/           # Pending tasks
â””â”€â”€ templates/         # Various templates
```

## Integration with /dev Workflow

### Standard Development Cycle (called from prompt.md)

1. **Task Start Sequence**:

   ```
   # Step 0: Manual check via /dev command
   Read progress/SUMMARY.md
   Read progress/IN_PROGRESS.md
   
   # Step 1: Task selection (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"
   - prompt: "analyze"
   â†’ Output: Selected task ID (e.g., "03-01") and rationale
   
   # Step 2: Mark task as started (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"  
   - prompt: "start 03-01"
   â†’ Output: Task start confirmation message
   ```

2. **Task Implementation**:
   - Development proceeds with TDD cycle (using test agent)
   - Quality checks after each phase (using qa agent)

3. **Task Completion Sequence**:

   ```
   # Step 6: Mark task as completed (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"
   - prompt: "complete 03-01 with handover: [
       - Generated: .quality-assurance-report-03-01.md
       - Environment: Package X installed
       - Commands: npm test, npm run build
       - Issues: Known warning about Y
       - Cleanup: Removed temporary test files
     ]"
   â†’ Output: Task completion confirmation (includes HANDOVER.md update)
   
   # Step 7: Update project summary (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"
   - prompt: "summary"
   â†’ Output: Summary update confirmation
   ```

### Interruption Handling

- Automatically detect tasks in progress/IN_PROGRESS.md with no updates for 2+ hours
- Work state is saved in task files for easy resumption

## Implementation Notes

### File Path Resolution

- Progress management files are located in `progress/` directory (relative to project root)
- Task definition files are located in `tasks/` directory (relative to project root)
- When referencing files in this agent, use paths relative to project root (e.g., `progress/SUMMARY.md`, `tasks/01-01-project-setup.md`)

### Template Usage Pattern

When generating files from templates, follow this pattern:

```typescript
// Example: Generating SUMMARY.md
const summaryTemplate = readFile('progress/templates/summary.md');
const updatedSummary = fillTemplate(summaryTemplate, currentMetrics);
writeFile('progress/SUMMARY.md', updatedSummary);
```

### Task File Placement Rules

- **Initial task definitions**: Located in `tasks/` directory (if exists)
- **Fallback**: Use `progress/backlog/` if `tasks/` doesn't exist
- **In-progress tasks**: Moved to `progress/in-progress/`
- **Completed tasks**: Moved to `progress/completed/`

### Error Handling

- Task file not found: Report "No available tasks"
- Invalid YAML frontmatter: Skip that task and continue
- File operation errors: Report error details and abort
- tasks/ directory doesn't exist: Read from progress/backlog/

For detailed implementation examples and algorithm details, refer to documentation in the templates directory.
