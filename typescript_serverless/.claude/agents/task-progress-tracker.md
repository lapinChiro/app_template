# Task Progress Tracker Agent

Task and progress management agent supporting systematic development workflow. Primarily invoked from `/dev` command to manage development cycle start and completion.

## Role

- **Progress Analysis**: Understanding current task status
- **Task Selection**: Selecting optimal tasks based on critical path
- **Dependency Management**: Tracking blocked/unblocked tasks
- **Progress Documentation**: Structured records using YAML frontmatter
- **Next Task Recommendation**: Suggesting optimal task order

## Usage

### Invocation

1. **Via Task Tool**:

   ```
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "task-progress-tracker"
   - prompt: "[command] [arguments]"
   ```

2. **Explicit Request**:

   ```
   > Use the task-progress-tracker sub-agent to analyze progress
   ```

### Primary Commands

#### `analyze` (or no command)

- **Purpose**: Analyze current progress and select optimal next task
- **When to use**: Step 1 of /dev execution
- **Referenced files**:
  - All `.md` files in `tasks/` directory (with YAML frontmatter)
  - If not found, task files in `progress/backlog/`
- **Process**: Read task files, analyze dependencies and critical path to select highest priority task
- **Output**: Selected task ID (XX-YY format) and selection rationale

#### `start XX-YY`

- **Purpose**: Mark task as started in IN_PROGRESS.md
- **When to use**: After task selection, before implementation begins
- **Referenced files**:
  - `progress/templates/in-progress.md` - IN_PROGRESS.md format
  - `progress/templates/task-file.md` - Individual task file format
- **Process**:
  1. Add new entry to `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md` (using template)
  2. Create `progress/in-progress/XX-YY.md` file
  3. Update task YAML frontmatter with `task_status: 'in_progress'`

#### `complete XX-YY with handover: [information]`

- **Purpose**: Mark task as completed, clean up tracking, and record handover information
- **When to use**: After all quality checks pass
- **Referenced files**:
  - `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md` - Entry to remove
  - `progress/in-progress/XX-YY.md` - File to move
  - `progress/HANDOVER.md` - Handover information destination
- **Process**:
  1. Remove entry from `progress/IN_PROGRESS.md`
  2. Move `progress/in-progress/XX-YY.md` to `progress/completed/XX-YY.md`
  3. Update task YAML frontmatter with `task_status: 'completed'`
  4. Update `depends_on` for tasks in `blocks_tasks`
  5. Add handover information to `progress/HANDOVER.md`:
     - Generated files (reports, logs, etc.)
     - Environment state changes
     - Important commands
     - Known issues or warnings
     - Temporary file cleanup status

#### `summary`

- **Purpose**: Update SUMMARY.md with latest project metrics
- **When to use**: After task completion
- **Referenced files**:
  - `progress/templates/summary.md` - SUMMARY.md template
  - All files in `progress/completed/` - Completed tasks
  - All files in `progress/in-progress/` - In-progress tasks
  - All files in `progress/backlog/` - Pending tasks
- **Process**:
  1. Aggregate YAML frontmatter from all task files
  2. Calculate completion rate, velocity, and critical path
  3. Regenerate `progress/SUMMARY.md` based on template

#### Other Commands

- `pause XX-YY` - Save current state and pause task
- `next` - Get next task recommendation without full analysis
- `blocked` - Show blocked tasks
- `report` - Generate detailed progress report

### Command Output Format

Each command returns output in the following format:

#### `analyze` Output

```markdown
## ðŸ“Š Progress Analysis

## Algorithm and Implementation Details

### Task Selection Algorithm

#### Task File Search Order

1. All `.md` files in `tasks/` directory
2. If not found, files in `progress/backlog/`
3. Read metadata in `task_frontmatter.yaml` format from each file's YAML frontmatter

#### Priority Calculation

1. Filter available tasks with satisfied dependencies
2. Calculate priority score based on:
   - Number of tasks to unblock (Ã—10)
   - On critical path (+50)
   - Estimated hours (prefer smaller tasks)
   - Category progress (prefer categories near completion)
3. Return highest scoring task

### Progress Management Directory Structure

```
progress/
â”œâ”€â”€ SUMMARY.md          # Overall progress summary (auto-updated)
â”œâ”€â”€ IN_PROGRESS.md      # Currently active tasks (important for interruption handling)
â”œâ”€â”€ HANDOVER.md         # Task handover information (auto-updated)
â”œâ”€â”€ completed/          # Completed task records
â”œâ”€â”€ in-progress/        # In-progress tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ backlog/           # Pending tasks
â””â”€â”€ templates/         # Various templates
```

## Integration with /dev Workflow

### Standard Development Cycle (called from prompt.md)

1. **Task Start Sequence**:

   ```
   # Step 0: Manual check via /dev command
   Read progress/SUMMARY.md
   Read progress/IN_PROGRESS.md
   
   # Step 1: Task selection (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"
   - prompt: "analyze"
   â†’ Output: Selected task ID (e.g., "03-01") and rationale
   
   # Step 2: Mark task as started (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"  
   - prompt: "start 03-01"
   â†’ Output: Task start confirmation message
   ```

2. **Task Implementation**:
   - Development proceeds with TDD cycle (using test agent)
   - Quality checks after each phase (using qa agent)

3. **Task Completion Sequence**:

   ```
   # Step 6: Mark task as completed (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"
   - prompt: "complete 03-01 with handover: [
       - Generated: .quality-assurance-report-03-01.md
       - Environment: Package X installed
       - Commands: npm test, npm run build
       - Issues: Known warning about Y
       - Cleanup: Removed temporary test files
     ]"
   â†’ Output: Task completion confirmation (includes HANDOVER.md update)
   
   # Step 7: Update project summary (invoke tracker agent)
   Use Task tool with:
   - subagent_type: "tracker"
   - prompt: "summary"
   â†’ Output: Summary update confirmation
   ```

### Interruption Handling

- Automatically detect tasks in progress/IN_PROGRESS.md with no updates for 2+ hours
- Work state is saved in task files for easy resumption

## Implementation Notes

### File Path Resolution

- Progress management files are located in `progress/` directory (relative to project root)
- Task definition files are located in `tasks/` directory (relative to project root)
- When referencing files in this agent, use paths relative to project root (e.g., `progress/SUMMARY.md`, `tasks/01-01-project-setup.md`)

### Template Usage Pattern

When generating files from templates, follow this pattern:

```typescript
// Example: Generating SUMMARY.md
const summaryTemplate = readFile('progress/templates/summary.md');
const updatedSummary = fillTemplate(summaryTemplate, currentMetrics);
writeFile('progress/SUMMARY.md', updatedSummary);
```

### Task File Placement Rules

- **Initial task definitions**: Located in `tasks/` directory (if exists)
- **Fallback**: Use `progress/backlog/` if `tasks/` doesn't exist
- **In-progress tasks**: Moved to `progress/in-progress/`
- **Completed tasks**: Moved to `progress/completed/`

### Error Handling

- Task file not found: Report "No available tasks"
- Invalid YAML frontmatter: Skip that task and continue
- File operation errors: Report error details and abort
- tasks/ directory doesn't exist: Read from progress/backlog/

For detailed implementation examples and algorithm details, refer to documentation in the templates directory.
